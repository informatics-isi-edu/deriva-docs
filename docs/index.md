# DERIVA Documentation

This website is the home for documentation for the DERIVA framework.

[DERIVA](http://deriva.isrd.isi.edu/) is an innovative open-source scientific asset management platform designed to support collaborative, data driven scientific investigations. DERVIA can adapt to evolving and complex data models and data types. DERIVA supports continuous FAIRness by promoting self-curation, fine-grain access control, automated creation of global unique IDs for every data element, versioning, provenance, exchange of data through structured and documented data collections (BDBags).

DERIVA provides authentication, fine-grained authorization, secured access, and extensive logging. The authentication service works with many options, including the ability for users to authenticate with their NIH or home institutions via [Globus Auth](https://www.globus.org/tags/globus-auth), which is an OAUTH2 authentication and authorization infrastructure widely used in NIH environments. DERIVA supports Globus Groups in fine-grained access policy.
