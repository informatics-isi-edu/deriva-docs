## Detail page

From the search results, click the View icon to open the "Detail" or "Record" page. This displays the metadata and links to the other related records and data files as available.

The following screenshots show an example record page from our example repository:

### Summary section

The page starts with a Summary section that lists available metadata.

### Related data sections

Further down are sections for related data. These are other data records that are linked to this one.

For example, in the demo repository a Study record is linked to one more Experiments, which show up in the "Experiments" section.

This connection and linkage between data records is one of the powerful features of DERIVA that allows for broader discovery of data rather than a flat listing of information.

### Refine search column

The left sidebar is a 'Table of Contents' of sorts for the record page. Every section is linked there and you can click to go directly to that section.
