#Introduction

This site is the home for documentation about Hatrac, a simple object storage service for web-based, data-oriented collaboration. Part of the DERIVA framework.

(the only thing we're missing so far is being able to auto-include the README file for the repo. using a relative path in the config file doesn't work.)
