# DERIVA Client Tools

In addition to the Chaise web interface (described in [primary components doc](link), DERIVA offers other client applications for end users.
* a desktop GUI that data submitters can use to authenticate with the deployment and upload data files and
* command line interface for interacting with the data.


## Desktop clients (deriva-qt)

DERIVA provides [Graphical User Interface tools](deriva-qt/index.html) for submitting data to a DERIVA platform:

* An Authentication Agent that connects with your DERIVA security credentials.
* File Upload for uploading data from your local environment. This tool is best when you are uploading from your own computer and it's not a very large amount of data.

* [Graphical User Interface Desktop Client tools](deriva-qt/index.html)
