# Exporting Metadata as CSV

Chaise provides multiple options for exporting data from a deployment. Note that this capability is different than links to download files, which may be available on a recordset (search results) or record (detail) page.

* You can export a CSV file of metadata
* You can use the more advanced BAG method to export all of the data - including metadata and files either locally or to a remote destination.

## Exporting metadata to CSV

You can download a CSV file of the results by clicking the Export button and choosing "CSV".

When you Export to CSV from a search results page, the CSV will include the metadata displayed in the search results in tabular format - for every record in the search results, not just the first page of results displayed.

SCREENSHOTS

When you Export to CSV from a detail page, the CSV will include one row with the metadata displayed in the Summary section (the top of the page, not the related tables).
