# Schema Annotations

**Chaise** is using the following current [schema annotations keys](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/ermrest/blob/master/docs/api-doc/model/naming.md#schema-annotations):

 - **comment**: contains a JSON array

It is expected in the future that key to be renamed to some useful URL.

The below tables explains the meaning of the possible values for the key.

- **_comment_** _key_ _values_

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| exclude | The schema is "excluded" from the catalog. None of its tables will be displayed in the list of the available tables. |
| default | By default (when the schema name is not specified in the URL or in the _chaise-config.js_ file), the tables of that schema will be used. |

## Examples

Set the _legacy_ schema as the default one:

    PUT /ermrest/catalog/1/schema/legacy/annotation/comment HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com
    Content-Type: text/csv
    Accept: text/csv

    ["default"]

Exclude the tables of the _Microscopy_ schema:

    PUT /ermrest/catalog/1/schema/Microscopy/annotation/comment HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com
    Content-Type: text/csv
    Accept: text/csv

    ["exclude"]

# Table Annotations

**Chaise** is using the following current [table annotations keys](https://github.com/informatics-isi-edu/ermrest/blob/master/docs/api-doc/model/naming.md#table-annotations):

| nested | The table has a FOREIGN KEY column to a parent table. It will not be displayed in the list of the available tables. |
| preview | The table has a column that is a FOREIGN KEY to a table containing the 3-D image file. The images will be rendered with a 3-D viewer. |
| reference | The table has columns with external references links. |

    Host: www.example.com
    Content-Type: text/csv
    Accept: text/csv

    ["default"]

Display the _dataset_ table as _FaceBase 1 Data_:

    PUT /ermrest/catalog/1/schema/legacy/table/dataset/annotation/description HTTP/1.1
