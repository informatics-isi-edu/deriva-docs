# Introduction for End Users

## Who is this for?

This guide describes how end users, such as biomedical researchers, clinicians, or students, interact with a deployment of DERIVA Chaise (usually referred to as a Data Browser or Data Explorer) to filter through a usually very large repository of disparate data types to find particular data that is, for example, related to a particular gene or antibody in a user's current experiment.

## Features and capabilities

DERIVA is designed to allow the end user to:

* Narrow a list of data by various attributes via filters in a sidebar or through free text search.
* Browse and access metadata and related data.
* Download available data files from a record.
* Export metadata as a CSV file or export large files to a BDBAG and use our client tools to materialize the files to a local environment or remote cluster.
