# Introduction for End Users

## Who is this for?

This guide is for those who want to use a deployment of DERIVA Chaise (usually referred to as a Data Browser or Data Explorer) to filter through a usually very large repository of disparate data types to find particular data that is, for example, related to a particular gene or antibody you are using in a current experiment.

*Talk about different kinds of users to date: biomedical researchers, clinicians, students, etc..*

## Features and capabilities

DERIVA is designed to allow the end user to:

* Narrow a list of data by various attributes via filters in a sidebar or through free text search.
* Access metadata, related data and download files (depending on the access rights set by that deployment - ie, some deployments may require you to create an account to access or download certain types of data).
* Download available data files.
* Export metadata as a CSV file or, if you want to download large files or if a particular dataset includes many files, you can export to a BAG and use our client tools to materialize the files to your local environment or remote cluster.
