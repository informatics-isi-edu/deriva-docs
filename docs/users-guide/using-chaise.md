# Using the Chaise Data Browser

Chaise, also referred to as the Data Browser, serves the user interface for the data portal and provides views of the data based on the underlying data model and annotations. (For those with xyz roles, you can learn how to manage the model and annotations in [Managing Catalogs](/users-guide/managing-data.html).)

Chaise interfaces represent data via records that can be filtered via attributes in the sidebar.

## Anatomy of the Data Browser

The Chaise Data Browser is configured for a particular deployment. We'll be using some current examples to illustrate the common elements, but the actual data, columns and attributes displayed vary per context.

Above is a typical example using Facebase (facebase.org). Common elements are:

* Filtering sidebar
* Search bar above the results
* Search results based on filters.

TBD

There are record pages which show the details of a particular record.

When you see the view (eye) icon, clicking that will take you to a record.
