# DERIVA User's Guide

This guide focuses on how users can:

* Interact with the online user interface (Chaise) to view, filter, browse data and in the case of data submitters, submit metadata. 
* Manage data (uploading/downloading files via GUIs, commandline clients or programmatically)
* Manage basic catalog tasks (update the data model, make annotations to manipulate )
